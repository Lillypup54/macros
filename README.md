📘 Totem Auto Script – README
⚠️ Requirements Before You Start:
✅ Buy Storage in-game, or the script won't collect anything.

✅ Own Totems in your hotbar slots (1–5 only). (not nesasery for colection only)

✅ Run in a Private Server. Public servers can interfere (players can buy stands outside your plot and mess things up).

🕹️ Controls:
Press G to open the Control Panel.

Press F to start the automation (based on your selected options).

Click Stop to gracefully stop the script.

Click Kill to instantly close the script.

Check Collect-Only Mode to auto-collect every second (presses E), without using any totems.

Check Discord Setup? if applicable (not implemented yet but will do!).

Use the checkboxes (Slot 1–5) to choose which totem slots to use.

Enter how many totems are in each selected slot.

The script automatically switches between selected slots and uses the totems, with cooldowns.

📁 Notes:
Script writes and reads from totems_popped.txt to track runtime and stats.

If it finds the word stop inside that file, the script stops immediately.(this is for discord bot not implemented yet)

Tooltip will show pop count, cooldown, and time during execution.
