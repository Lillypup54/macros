It looks like your README.md content is missing blank lines between sections and bullet points, which can make it hard to read in Markdown. Adding blank lines improves formatting by separating headings, paragraphs, and lists. I’ll also add some formatting “spice” with bold, emojis, and improved structure for clarity and style.

Here’s your README.md with improved formatting and extra flair:

```markdown
# 📘 Totem Auto Script – README

**NEW!!!!** ✨ _Added 158 new lines!! v2.5_

---

## ⚠️ Requirements Before You Start

- ✅ **Buy Storage in-game**, or the script won't collect anything.
- ✅ **Own Totems in your hotbar slots (1–5 only).**  
  _(Not necessary for collection only)_
- ✅ **Run in a Private Server.**  
  Public servers can interfere (players can buy stands outside your plot and mess things up).

---

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Press `G`** to open the Control Panel.
- **Press `F`** to start the automation (based on your selected options).
- **Click `Stop`** to gracefully stop the script.
- **Click `Kill`** to instantly close the script.
- **Check `Collect-Only Mode`** to auto-collect every second (presses `E`), without using any totems.
- **Check `Discord Setup?`** if applicable _(not implemented yet but will do!)_.
- **Use the checkboxes (Slot 1–5)** to choose which totem slots to use.
- **Enter** how many totems are in each selected slot.
- The script automatically switches between selected slots and uses the totems, with cooldowns.

---

## 📁 Notes

- Script writes and reads from `totems_popped.txt` to track runtime and stats.
- If it finds the word `stop` inside that file, the script stops immediately.  
  _(This is for Discord bot, not implemented yet)_
- Tooltip will show **pop count, cooldown, and time** during execution.
