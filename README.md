Welcome to the Totem Macro System! This project provides both **P2W** and **F2P** macros for totem popping and auto collect, with optional Discord bot support.

This repository has two main paths:

- **P2W Macro**  
  Designed for players using **auto collect**.  
  ⚠️ *Still in development.*

- **F2P Macro**  
  Works **without any game passess**, based purely on user input.  
  ✅ Fully functional via AutoHotkey.

- **Python** (optional) — only needed if you want to use the Discord bot  
  Make sure to:
  - Install Python 3.8+
  - Set up your **own Discord bot token** in the script

## 🔄 How to Use

1. **Pick a branch** depending on which macro you want to use:
   - `f2p-macro`
   - `p2w-macro` *(still being built)*
2. Download the files from that branch.
3. Run the `.ahk` file (after installing AutoHotkey).
4. If using the Discord bot, configure your Python environment and bot token.

## 📦 Current Status

- ✅ F2P Macro – fully working
- 🚧 P2W Macro – in development

## ❗ Note

The script logs totem usage, cooldowns, and session time. It also responds to a text file containing the word `stop`, which will **immediately terminate the script**.
